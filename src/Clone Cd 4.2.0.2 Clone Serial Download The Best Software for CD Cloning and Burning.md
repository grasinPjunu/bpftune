## Step 4: Use CloneCD 4.2.0.2
 
To use CloneCD, you need to have a CD drive and a blank CD-R or CD-RW disc. You can also use a virtual drive and an ISO image file instead of a physical disc.
 
To copy a CD, insert the source CD in your drive and launch CloneCD. Click on Copy CD and select your source drive from the drop-down menu.
 
Click Next and choose a profile for your copy. The profile determines how CloneCD will handle the copy protection and other features of the source CD.
 
Click Next and select your destination drive from the drop-down menu.
 
Click Next and choose a name for your copy.
 
Click OK and wait for CloneCD to finish copying your CD.
 
To create an ISO image of a CD, insert the source CD in your drive and launch CloneCD. Click on Read to Image File and select your source drive from the drop-down menu.
 
Click Next and choose a profile for your image file.
 
Click Next and choose a name and location for your image file.
 
Click OK and wait for CloneCD to finish creating your image file.
