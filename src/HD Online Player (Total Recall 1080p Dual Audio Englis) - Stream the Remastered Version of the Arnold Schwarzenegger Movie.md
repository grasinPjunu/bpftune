Total Recall (2012) is a movie that explores the themes of identity, memory, and reality. The movie follows Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), a factory worker who is dissatisfied with his life and decides to visit Rekall, a company that can implant fake memories of a life he would like to have. However, things go wrong and Quaid discovers that he is actually a spy who has been implanted with false memories by his former boss, Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston). Quaid then teams up with Melina (Jessica Biel), a rebel fighter who claims to know his true past, and tries to stop Cohaagen from launching a war against the resistance.
 
The movie is set in a futuristic world where most of the Earth has been devastated by chemical warfare and only two regions remain habitable: the United Federation of Britain (UFB) and the Colony (Australia). The UFB is a wealthy and powerful state that exploits the Colony for cheap labor and resources. The Colony is a poor and oppressed region that suffers from overcrowding and pollution. The two regions are connected by a massive elevator called the Fall, which transports workers from the Colony to the UFB every day. The resistance is a group of rebels who fight against Cohaagen's tyranny and seek to liberate the Colony.
 
The movie is a remake of the 1990 movie of the same name, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone. The 1990 movie was loosely based on Philip K. Dick's short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, which was published in 1966. The 2012 movie differs from the 1990 movie and the original story in several ways, such as the setting, the characters, the plot twists, and the ending. The 2012 movie also features more advanced technology and special effects, such as hover cars, robots, holograms, and scanners.
